<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29373869/136696762-744aa391-fec4-4594-9b0c-711af7b4b6e3.png)


This is a simple TODO list.

Features:
* Creating a task – The user writes the task on an input text field and clicks the “Create”
button. The task is then added to the list and marked as incomplete.
* Marking a task as complete/incomplete – The user clicks the checkbox on the left of the list
entry, which toggles its state.
* Editing a task – Clicking the “Edit” link on the right side of the list entry should allow the task
name to be edited. You can display an input text field in-place, or re-use the task creation
form.
* Deleting a task – Clicking the “Delete” link on the right side of the list entry should delete the
entry.
* Filtering the list – Toggling the “Hide completed” checkbox on the bottom of the list should
filter the completed entries from the list.
* Sorting the list – Clicking the “Tasks” list header should sort the list alphabetically from A to
Z, clicking it again should change the order from Z to A, and a third time return to the default
sorting (by creation date).
* Local Storage- The browser stores the information. Basically the user doesn't lose any information
after reloading or revisiting the page.
